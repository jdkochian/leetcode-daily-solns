# LeetCode Daily Question Solutions

This repository houses _my_ solutions for the daily coding challenge on leetcode.com. These are generally going to be done in python and also updated both asynchronously and infrequently. It also houses a somewhat readable way to test test cases locally using `runner.py`.

### TODO:

- Rework test case class to package to support relative imports
    - Programmatically rename files to support 
- Fill in backlog of solutions (ongoing)
